# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-30

### Added
- **Hexagonal Architecture Implementation**: Complete restructure to follow Ports & Adapters pattern
- **Domain Layer**: Separated business logic into `internal/domain/` with clear boundaries
- **Port Interfaces**: Defined clear contracts for external dependencies
- **Adapter Pattern**: Implemented infrastructure adapters for database, storage, and streaming
- **Shared Domain Utilities**: Common ports, errors, and value objects across domains
- **Reusable Middleware Package**: Configurable middleware components in `pkg/middleware/`
- **Enhanced File Domain**: Complete file management with metadata persistence
- **Redis Cache Adapter**: New caching layer for improved performance
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed architecture and development guides
- **Enhanced Testing**: Updated all tests to work with new architecture

### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Reorganized codebase to follow hexagonal architecture principles
- **Service Name**: Renamed from "Todo Service" to "TaskFlow"
- **Folder Organization**: Moved `internal/interfaces/http` to `adapter/http` for consistency
- **Port Interfaces**: Centralized shared ports in `internal/domain/shared/ports.go`
- **Service Dependencies**: Updated services to use shared interfaces (Messaging, Cache, Storage)
- **Dependency Injection**: Improved dependency management in main application
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with shared domain errors
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns between layers

### Architecture Improvements
- **Domain Independence**: Business logic is now completely independent of external frameworks
- **Testability**: Much easier to unit test with proper dependency injection
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make the codebase more maintainable
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap out implementations (e.g., different databases)
- **Scalability**: Better foundation for future enhancements and microservices

### Technical Details
- **Domain Models**: Moved to `internal/domain/{domain}/model.go`
- **Port Interfaces**: Defined in `internal/domain/{domain}/port.go`
- **Domain Services**: Implemented in `internal/domain/{domain}/service.go`
- **Infrastructure Adapters**: Located in `adapter/` directory
- **Interface Adapters**: HTTP handlers in `internal/interfaces/http/`

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated with hexagonal architecture information
- **docs/architecture.md**: Comprehensive architecture documentation
- **docs/development.md**: Development guide and best practices
- **docs/api.md**: Updated API documentation

### Breaking Changes
- **Import Paths**: All import paths have been updated to reflect new structure
- **Service Interfaces**: Changed from generic service interfaces to domain-specific services
- **Repository Interfaces**: Moved from global interfaces to domain-specific ports

### Migration Guide
If migrating from the previous version:

1. **Update Import Paths**: All imports need to be updated to new structure
2. **Service Usage**: Use domain services instead of generic service interfaces
3. **Dependency Injection**: Update dependency injection in main application
4. **Testing**: Update test files to use new domain structure

### Future Enhancements
- **Authentication Domain**: Ready for JWT/OAuth2 implementation
- **Caching Layer**: Easy to add Redis caching adapter
- **Message Queues**: Prepared for RabbitMQ/Kafka integration
- **GraphQL Interface**: Alternative to REST API
- **Microservices**: Foundation for service decomposition
